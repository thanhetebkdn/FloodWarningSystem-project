# Flood Warning System using FreeRTOS on STM32F4 Board

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a flood warning system using FreeRTOS on the STM32F4 board. The system uses various sensors to monitor environmental factors and alert users in case of flood risk.

## System Components

The system includes the following main components:

- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Measures the ambient temperature and humidity.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance from the sensor to the water surface, helping to determine water levels.
- **Rain Sensor**: Detects the presence of rain.
- **Alarm Buzzer**: Alerts users when there is a flood risk.

## System Operation

1. **Data Collection**:

   - The **DHT11 sensor** measures the ambient temperature and humidity. This data is used to assess general weather conditions.
   - The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures the distance from the sensor to the water surface. When this distance falls below a predefined threshold, the system determines that the water level is rising.
   - The **Rain Sensor** detects the presence of rain, providing information about the current weather conditions.

2. **Data Processing**:

   - Data collected from the sensors is processed by the STM32F4 microcontroller.
   - FreeRTOS manages the tasks of collecting and processing data from the sensors efficiently, ensuring smooth and continuous operation of the system.

3. **Alerting**:
   - When the sensor data indicates a flood risk (e.g., water level exceeds the safe threshold and/or heavy rain is detected), the system activates the alarm buzzer to notify the user.
